## Raw Version

This here is the Raw version of the CSS Files used. These **Will Not** work on their own.
These lack the Meta data which is needed by BetterDiscord to function...

These versions are what the Auto updating version of the theme will download upon booting Discord.
If you would like that go to the Theme Folder on this Github.
